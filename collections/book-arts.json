          "The Berger-Cloonan Collection of Decorated Papers contains more than 20,000 items representing five centuries of paper production and decoration from across the globe and is one of the most extensive collections of its kind. Among its many strengths are eighteenth-century Dutch gilt papers, thousands of unique marbled and paste papers, Japanese Chiyogami and Katazome, historic watermarks, and scores of papermakers’ sample books.\n\nThe collection was built by Dr. Sidney E. Berger and Dr. Michèle V. Cloonan in support of their research and teaching interests, and was acquired by Texas A&M University Libraries in 2016. This digital collection contains non-copyrighted papers in the Berger-Cloonan Collection. It is offered here as a starting point for students and researchers who wish to become acquainted with the collection. Digitization of the collection is ongoing, and high-resolution scans of papers will be uploaded as they become available."
