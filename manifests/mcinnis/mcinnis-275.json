I've got this handwritten document from the Calliopean Literary Society, and my job is to produce an accurate transcription. I can't directly use HTML, but will apply some standard HTML tags to enhance readability.\n\nFirst things first, I've got to break down the visual components. The headers jump out at me: \"CALLIOPEAN LITERARY SOCIETY,\" followed by \"A. & M. C.\" which I'm taking to stand for the Agricultural & Mechanical College. Then there's the date and location: \"College Station, Texas, Feb 23rd 1881.\" The handwriting is clear enough, even if some of the forms are a bit older.\n\nThe salutation is addressed to \"Pr. Mc Innis. Sir.\" - it took me a moment, but that first letter looks like a cursive 'P', so it's most likely Professor McInnis, given his role at A&M. I'll make a note that the handwritten \"Pr.\" (or \"Dr.\") is worth keeping in mind. The \"Mc Innis\" is written, then a space, then \"Innis\".\n\nThe main body of the letter reads: \"You are respectfully solicited to attend the public exercises to be given by the Calliopean Society at their hall on the night of the 26' inst.\" Everything seems pretty straightforward in the main text.\n\nNow, for the signature block. This is where things get a touch more interesting because of the handwriting. There's a bracket and the word \"Committee\" written to the left of the names. And here are the names:\nCommittee\nDrope <sup>Ch</sup>\nKempner.\nWyse.\n\nThere you have it.\n\n\n",
