                                "value": "**Detailed Transcription and Analysis of Financial Comparison**\n\nOkay, here's what I've got. This is a transcription and analysis of a handwritten document comparing the financial situations of the \"University\" and the \"A & M College\". Based on my assessment, it seems to be a financial report or comparison, likely for some official use given the level of detail and the specific timeframes mentioned. I can see the structure right away. Here's a detailed transcription with my notes and annotations:\n\n<p>Comparison between the University and the A & M College<br>\nComparison made to June 1886 because the Report of Regents ends at that date-</p>\n\n|  | Amounts Expended | |\n|---|---|---|\n| University | 1881 - June 1886 | 261788 44 |\n|  | Annual Average for 5 years | 52357 68 |\n\n|  |  |  |\n|---|---|---|\n| A & M College | From U.S. Endowment Interest (about) | 150000 |\n| 1871 - 86 15 years | State appropriations | 285896 40 |\n|  | Total from all sources - | 435896 40 |\n|  | Annual Average from all sources | 29059 76 |\n|  | \" \" State | 19059 76 |\n|  | From University Fund 50,000 Ann. average | 3333 33 |\n\n<p>[Margin:]<br>\nTotal<br>\n414896 40<br>\n264896 40<br>\n35000</p>\n\n<p>Or deducting amt for State Students<br>\nwe have for A & M College</p>\n\n|  |  | |\n|---|---|---|\n|  | Annual average all sources | 27659 76 |\n|  | \" \" State | 17659 76 |\n|  | \" \" Univ Fund | 2333 33 |\n\n<p>It has been stated that the College has a much larger plant than the University but in such statements no account is taken of the fact that the College has been established three times as long as the University-</p>\n\n<p>The fact that the College has more property than the University only shows how economically its affairs have been administered - for if we deduct the amount used for State Students we have as total amount which the A & M. College has received from State for a period of 15 years from 1871 to June 1886 $264896.40</p>\n\n<p>The University has in five years from 1881-1886 expended $261788.44</p>\n\n<p>While the University has cost the State nearly as much in 5 years as the College has in 15 years, yet the College has a much more valuable property for the State than the University has</p>\n\nSo, what's happening here? It appears to be a comparative financial analysis. I've broken it down into sections:\n\n*   **Header and Intro:** Sets the scene \u2013 comparing the two institutions, limiting the time frame.\n*   **University Data:** Displays expenditures for the University over a five-year period.\n*   **A & M College Data:** Gives figures for A & M College covering a much longer period. Notably, it sources funds.\n*   **Deductions:** There's a deduction for \"State Students,\" which adjusts the figures for A & M, and shows calculations made in the left margin. The deduction seems to have been based on 35000 or 1400/year for 15 years.\n*   **Textual Analysis/Comparison:** The concluding paragraphs put these numbers into context. The writer is emphasizing that, while the University has spent almost as much as the College in a much shorter period, the College has more valuable assets. This is related to how long it has been established.\n\nImportant notes, and observations:\n\n*   **Handwriting:** It is cursive, somewhat messy, but generally legible. There are corrections and some numbers are overwritten. I've done my best with the numerals.\n*   **Marginalia:** The margin notes seem to be important to the calculations, and I transcribed them.\n*   **\"Amounts Expended\" note:** This line is inserted, suggesting it was added after the initial\n\n",

From what I can see, we've got some handwritten financial data here, probably from June 1886. It looks like a comparison between the \"University\" (likely the University of Texas, given the A&M context) and the Agricultural and Mechanical College (A&M). The handwriting is cursive and a bit rushed. The author appears to have written on lined ledger paper and made some corrections, which is useful in some ways, and distracting in others! We're dealing with things like sessions, expenditures, state appropriations, and endowments. The numbers are indented, probably indicating a tabular layout of sorts.\n\nHere's my transcription, line by line, aiming for accuracy while preserving the original layout and any quirks I spot:\n\n<p>\n3\n</p>\n<p>\nIn June 1886 the University Completed<br>\nits 3<sup>rd</sup> session The A & M College its<br>\n10<sup>th</sup> - The University had expended $261 788.44\n</p>\n<p>\nAverage Cost per session since the Univ.<br>\nhad been opened $ 87262.81\n</p>\n<p>\nThe A & M College expended to same date<br>\nfrom all sources $435 896.40\n</p>\n<p>\nAn average per session 10 sessions of 43589.64<br>\nFrom State appropriations 285896.40<br>\nAverage per session 28589.64\n</p>\n<p>\nOr deducting Amt [illegible] State Students<br>\nThe Average for ten sessions $ 26489.64\n</p>\n<p>\nCompare these figures -<br>\nThe College as a result had property valued at $228972.47<br>\nWhat has the University? <small>not more than $100 000 worth</small><br>\nIn three sessions the University [illegible]<br>\nfrom Univ fund 261788.44\n</p>\n<p>\nIn 15 years A & M C. had from<br>\nUniv fund exclusive of State<br>\nStudents 35000.00<br>\nOr with amt for State Students 50000.00\n</p>\n<p>\nThis is surely a \"small sized Grab\"\n</p>\n<p>\nComparison of Expenses 1885-86 Session\n</p>\n\n| | A & M College | University |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| State Appr. | 17108.96 | $54928.82 |\n| U.S. Endowment | 11993.48 | |\n| | $ 29102.44 | |\n<p>\nThe expense of A & M College was<br>\na little more than 1/2 that of Univ.\n</p>\n\n\n",
