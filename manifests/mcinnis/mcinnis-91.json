The key directives are to maintain natural reading order, ensure high accuracy (including original spelling and punctuation), interpret any handwriting, adhere to the specified HTML tags, and present lists in a Markdown table. Commentary is not requested.\n\nThen, I carefully examined the image, starting with the letterhead. I parsed the left side (officers and locations), the center (\"TEACHERS'…\"), and the right side (Executive Committee and locations). I took note of the handwritten date/location (\"New Orleans 12/28 1884\"), salutation (\"Dear McInnis\"), and the body of the letter itself, focusing on spelling (e.g., \"fuges\"), punctuation, and line breaks. I paid close attention to the emphasized words and phrases within the body of the letter. Finally, I examined the signature (\"R. H. Whitlock\").\n\nNext, I started drafting the transcription. I tackled the letterhead's structure, recognizing the need to replicate its layout. I used HTML tags to represent the side columns and centered title. Then, I transcribed the date, salutation, and body, accounting for any line breaks in the body. I meticulously transcribed the text, including the writer's idiosyncratic \"fuges\".\n\nAfter creating the draft, I refined the transcription's formatting. I ensured I adhered to the HTML tags, especially regarding the forbidden `<u>` tag. I opted for `<i>` to represent the emphasis/underlining for the word \"least\". I also considered the need to retain the visual layout with `<p>` and `<br>`. Then, I performed a final visual check on layout and spacing.\n\nI reevaluated the letterhead layout, aiming for a logical presentation based on the guideline \"Natural top-to-bottom, left-to-right\", and the reading hierarchy. I then made sure to arrange the left block, center title, and right block in order.\n\nI then did a detailed evaluation of each detail of the handwriting:\n\n*   \"New-Orleans\" included a dash.\n*   \"12/28\" - the 28 is slightly subscript but it's a fraction style.\n*   \"Mc Innis\" - there is a space.\n*   \"fuges\" - quotes are distinct.\n*   \"least\" - underlined. I'll use `<i>` as `<u>` is forbidden.\n*   \"full bent\" - quotes distinct.\n*   \"2. P.M.\" - dots used.\n*   \"R. H. Whitlock\" - Signature is at the bottom right.\n\nFinally, I assembled the final output, paying extra attention to the details of the handwriting and the required formatting. I double-checked the date and signature one last time before submitting the transcription, making sure it met all of the requirements.\n\n\n",
