The script is cursive, typical of the late 19th or early 20th century. The ink has a brownish tint, which I should note. Overall, the handwriting is quite legible, although I will need to take extra care with some words.\n\nI'll proceed line by line. First line reads \"saving money, and got another baby - He evidently doesn't believe in the doctrine of limiting population. The theory is easier than the practice -\" Then \"Drop me another line & let me know something about the Oxford rumpus -\" Next is \"Please present my regards, & Mrs B's to your wife -\". The next section reads, \"The thermometer in this country has been up to 110 in the shade - You can see the effects on this ink -\". The closing is \"Faithfully Yours\". Then, the signature looks to be \"W. L. Bringhurst.\"\n\nI need to transcribe this into HTML, using `<p>` for paragraphs and `<br>` for line breaks where appropriate to keep the same visual layout. I need to make sure to pay attention to where the indents are. I'll need to double check the capitalization and punctuation. I also need to be certain about the signature. The ampersand looks like a plus sign or cross.\n\nLet's begin.\n\n<p>saving money, and got another<br>\nbaby - He evidently doesn't believe<br>\nin the doctrine of limiting population.<br>\nThe theory is easier than the practice -</p>\n\n<p>Drop me another line & let<br>\nme know something about the Oxford<br>\nrumpus -</p>\n\n<p>Please present my regards, & Mrs<br>\nB's to your wife -</p>\n\n<p>The thermometer<br>\nin this country has been up to 110 in the<br>\nshade - You can see the effects on this<br>\nink -</p>\n\n<p>Faithfully Yours<br>\nW. L. Bringhurst.</p>\n\nOkay, I've used the approved HTML tags. Now, I should double check some words to make sure the transcription is correct.\n\n\"evidently\" - yes.\n\"doctrine\" - yes.\n\"limiting\" - yes.\n\"rumpus\" - yes.\n\"Mrs B's\" - yes. It looks like the signature 'B' on the signature.\n\"thermometer\" - yes.\n\"Bringhurst\" - yes, the handwriting is clear, and the signature matches.\n\nThe indentation in the original document looks like the start of new paragraphs.\n\nOkay, I think this is it. Ready to go.\n\n\n",
