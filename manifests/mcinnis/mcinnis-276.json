My focus is on accurate transcription while adhering to the specified formatting rules.** I need to produce *only* the transcription, and nothing more. I start by breaking down the instructions: I am a professional transcriptionist, and I need to render this text from an image. I must stick to these HTML tags: `a`, `b`, `br`, `i`, `img`, `p`, `small`, `span`, `sub`, `sup`. I should also pay attention to layout, punctuation, and handwriting interpretation.\n\nNext, I look at the image itself. I see a letterhead with the names \"GEORGE PFEUFFER\" and \"CHRISTOPH PFEUFFER,\" and the business name \"GEORGE PFEUFFER & BRO.\" with \"Dealers in Farming Tools...\" and so on. The date is \"June 8 1881,\" and the addressee is \"Professor L McInnis / A&M College.\" Then there's the salutation and body. The final closing and signature are \"Yours truly George Pfeuffer\".\n\nNow, I'll transcribe this piece by piece. First, the header with all its details; then the date and location; next, the addressee and salutation. After, I start with the body paragraphs, carefully deciphering the handwriting. I then move to formatting the transcription. I need to get the formatting right, keeping the layout, line breaks, and using the HTML tags as directed. I look for specific words \u2013 \"Emil Kellner\", \"Bachelors Hall\" \u2013 to make sure they're right. I'll use `<small>` for the top corner names, `<b>` for bold headers, `<p>` for paragraphs, and `<br>` for line breaks where they're needed to match the original. I will use `<i>` for the italicized line. Then I use `<sup>` for the superscript, \"th\" in \"5th\".\n\nI then make a draft of the output, building it mentally so I know I'm on track. I keep in mind the final guidelines, especially the allowed HTML elements. I need to keep the style clean and direct. I will format the text according to the line breaks in the text. I'll double-check details like the \"A&M\" abbreviation (looks like `A&M`), and \"account\" (the end trails off, but it's clearly the intended word), and make sure everything is in place, and adjust the header. I'm choosing HTML tags carefully. Finally, I will construct the final HTML block and produce the output based on my thinking. I will read it a final time to ensure accuracy before I finalize the output.\n\n\n",
