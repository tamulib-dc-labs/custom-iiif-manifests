McInnis Esq.<br>\nBryan, Texas.</p>\n\n<p align=\"right\">March 8<sup>th</sup> 1894.</p>\n\n<p>Dear Sir:- Altho' you could have had very little personal interest in the matter,<br>\nit would have been courtesy on my part, to have informed you, in the Summer of 1892<br>\nof the result of the Maryland College controversy, in which your former acquain-<br>\ntance Brunk figured, - and in connection with which you so kindly aided me.</p>\n\n<p>The said marplot apparently repeated his Texan operations, with some<br>\nvariations - but no improvements. He got just one member of our Faculty to<br>\njoin him - and I was forced to make an issue with those two. All others of the<br>\nFaculty - and every member of our (over-large) Board of Trustees who had served two<br>\nyears or more with me, - stood solidly by me. Brunk took advantage of the<br>\nincoming of a new element in the Board, - strong partisans, too, - anxious to find<br>\n- or to make, - places for their friends. So Brunk + Hird (his partner) got an<br>\nofficial following, who made them an excuse for the cry that there was<br>\nlack of harmony in the Faculty, - and that a general re-organization was needed.</p>\n\n<p>I had such strong backing, however, that the friends of Brunk (or those so<br>\nappearing) came to me, and offered to compromise + re-elect me + the entire<br>\nFaculty, if I would withdraw my charges agt. Brunk and Hird. This I<br>\npositively declined, - and Brunk and Hird were then dropped. My<br>\nre-election was postponed - and I \"held over\" some months. But those two</p></span>",

I've got an image in front of me, and my job is to extract the text. This isn't just about mechanically copying characters; it's about understanding the *structure* and the intent behind it. This letterhead, \"ASSOCIATION OF American Agricultural Colleges AND Experiment Stations,\" is the first piece.\n\nMy initial approach is to break it down into logical blocks. The letterhead is arranged in three columns, each containing specific information. On the left, we've got the \"OFFICERS, 1893-94\" \u2013 President, Vice-Presidents, and the Secretary/Treasurer. Then in the center, the prominent title of the association and the address. On the right is the \"EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE, 1893-94.\" It appears someone made a red \"X\" through the right column, but for the purpose of the transcription, I'll focus on the text itself unless instructed otherwise.\n\nI can make a markdown table for this three-column layout. The central header is quite dominant, the columns are secondary.\n\nHere's the data, organized. I'll include the subtle font variations \u2013 small caps, etc. I'll maintain the original line breaks for clarity:\n\n| OFFICERS, 1893-94. | ASSOCIATION <br> OF <br> American Agricultural Colleges <br> AND <br> Experiment Stations. | EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE, <br> 1893-94. |\n| :------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| <small>PRESIDENT.</small> <br> Gen.

They wanted three more and<br>\nmoved agt. three professors who had loyally stood by me, & the good work<br>\nof the College. I did the only fair thing, - and stood by them, - a long<br>\ncontest followed, - and finally we all went out together.</p>\n\n<p>Brother Brunk has been wandering, since. I have heard of him in<br>\nIllinois and Indiana, - he started a little \"College\" of his own somewhere<br>\nin the Indiana swamps, - but was disappointed in its endowment, -<br>\nowing to the hard times (! - ?) - and it lived only a few weeks.</p>\n\n<p>Last year, - I was fully employed in looking out for the Collective<br>\nCollege & Station Exhibit at Chicago, - was there till December.</p>\n\n<p>Now, this Winter, - I have agreed to remain here, - (I live but 10 miles out, -)<br>\nand watch the interests of the Assn. There are some points in prospective<br>\nlegislation by Congress, giving a little anxiety, - but all will come out right.</p>\n\n<p>By early Summer, - I shall be foot-free, - hence I am already on the<br>\nlookout for occupation. Naturally, I prefer something in the line wh. I<br>\nhave been following for twenty years or more, - should an opening occur.</p>\n\n<p>Indirectly, I have heard that a new president of the Texas College<br>\nmight soon be wanted, - altho' why - or just when, I have not learned.<br>\nCan you tell me anything on this point? If there is to be a vacancy,<br>\ndo you think it would be worth while for me to become a candidate?<br>\nI think that with time and opportunity, - I can make up a strong case.</p>\n\n<p>Who constitute the present Board? - and are they men to be approached<br>\npurely on the qualifications basis, - or with some political influence added?</p>\n\n<p>I shall highly appreciate a reply.</p>\n\n<p>Hoping you are in good health & with personal regards - I am -<br>\nYours very truly - Henry E.

My task is straightforward: transcribe the text from this image of a handwritten letter. I'm operating as a professional transcriptionist, so I'll need to maintain the original spelling, punctuation, capitalization, and layout \u2013 including line breaks. Any illegible text will be marked as such. The only HTML tags allowed are the approved ones.\n\nNow, let's analyze the image itself. It's a handwritten letter, which immediately tells me I'll be dealing with cursive and stylistic variations. The content is key: Henry E. Alvord is discussing his professional history, specifically his departure from a college and his current work situation. He's also inquiring about a potential presidency at the Texas College. The letter appears to be structured in paragraphs, with a standard closing and signature.\n\nMy process will be methodical. I'll read the text line by line, paying close attention to every detail. For example, in the first paragraph, I see \"agt.\" which is likely an abbreviation for \"against,\" and the ampersand is distinct. The dashes are also important for the flow. I need to retain these minor variations.\n\nIn the second paragraph, I'll need to recognize \"Brother Brunk\" as a proper name. The quotation marks around \"College\" are deliberate. The strange punctuation \"(! - ?)\" also needs to be transcribed accurately.\n\nThe third paragraph mentions the \"Collective College & Station Exhibit,\" which seems to be a specific entity from a World's Fair. Proper nouns must be preserved.\n\nIn the fourth, the abbreviation \"Assn.\" for \"Association\" should be correctly transcribed, as well as the use of parentheses.\n\nThe fifth paragraph has a hyphenated word, \"foot-free,\" and the abbreviation \"wh.\" for \"which\" \u2013 all details I need to capture.\n\nThe sixth is particularly interesting, as I need to be careful with \"Texas College,\" and the apostrophe in \"altho'.\" There's also a crossed-out letter in what should be \"think,\" but I'm confident in the intended word. The line break in the layout and the context confirms this.\n\nThe seventh is standard cursive, and the eighth is a simple sentence.\n\nFinally, I reach the closing and signature. I'll need to preserve the formatting here, including the line break before \"Yours very truly - Henry E. Alvord.\"\n\nI'll be careful to wrap each paragraph in `<p>` tags. The prompt explicitly requests to \"Preserve... line breaks\", so I need to insert `<br>` at the end of each physical line within each paragraph to accurately represent the original layout.\n\nI'll check against the image, double-checking for consistency and accuracy. Then, finally, I'll assemble the final output using the correct tags. And then it's done.\n\nThe final result is just the transcribed text.\n\n\n",
