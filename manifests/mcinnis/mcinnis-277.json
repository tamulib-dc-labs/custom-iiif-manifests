College of Texas\" letterhead, dated February 25, 1881. It appears to be a request from someone named Geo. T. Olmsted, likely Captain George T. Olmsted, given the historical context of A&M, to a Professor McInnis. The writer is asking if McInnis will be taking a drive into town that evening and, if so, to be picked up around 5 o'clock so he can catch a train. He requests a response from the Quarter-guard within the next hour. The header font is very distinct, almost gothic or blackletter, with the college name and location printed. The date looks handwritten, including \"1881\". \"Dr\" is abbreviated with the \"r\" superscript. The \"c\" in \"McInnis\" appears to be raised. There's an ampersand, standard. The signature looks clear, and the title beneath seems to be \"Capt &c\". I've tried to capture the visual layout with `<br>` and `<p>` tags for sections. The \"25\" mark is tricky, could be a superscript 'th' or just a stroke, but I've transcribed it as \"25\". I'm omitting that archival tick mark in the upper right. And I'm ready to produce the HTML output requested.\n\n\n",
