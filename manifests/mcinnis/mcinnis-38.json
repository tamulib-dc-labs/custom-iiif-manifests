It starts with the header: *Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas,* followed by a sub-header on the left side: DEPARTMENT OF CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS. H. H. DINWIDDIE. On the right, it has the date: College Station, Texas, Feb 8 1883. \"Feb 8\" and \"3\" are handwritten.\n\nNext comes the body. The letter begins \"My dear McInnis -\" and I'll preserve all the line breaks.\n\n```html\n<p><i>Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas,</i></p>\n\n<p><small>DEPARTMENT OF<br/>\nCHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS.<br/>\nH.
