Here's how I'm approaching it:\n\nFirst, I'm carefully analyzing the image. It starts with the header \"Copy - of Letter to Board June 1890\", followed by \"College Sta June – 90\". The salutation is \"To the Honorable Board of Directors / A. + m., College of Texas\". The main text begins with: \"Gentlemen: I respectfully but earnestly request that you will give to my vouchers and books a searching investigation, in order that you may be able to testify to the correctness with which I have disbursed the funds of the A + m College, P. V. Normal School, and Agricultural Experiment Station –\".\n\nThe second paragraph continues: \"I also respectfully request you to take im- mediate steps to relieve me of my responsi- bility to the United States Government for the Arms & accoutrements issued to the College – and for the alcohol withdrawn from bond for use in the Chemical Laboratory\". The document is signed \"L. L. McInnis / Chm of Faculty\".\n\nAt the bottom is a note: \" As far as the record shows no notice was taken of this respect- ful communication & as far as I know no action was taken \".\n\nNow, I'm setting up my formatting guidelines: I'll preserve all spelling, punctuation, capitalization, and line breaks. HTML tags are allowed, and I'll use those judiciously, sticking to the allowed list, to keep it clean.\n\nI'm paying close attention to the handwriting. \"A + m\" is a bit ambiguous; it looks like a lowercase 'm', not a capital, but given the context of Texas A&M, it might be an intentional stylization of the capital 'M'. I'll transcribe this as it appears, but flag it for context. Specifically, in the header it's \"A. + m.\". In the main text, I'll record what I see: \"A + m\". It could be \"A & m\".\n\"P. V. Normal School\" I have confirmed to be Prairie View. \"accoutrements\" is spelled as I would expect.\nThe signature \"L. L. McInnis\", with \"Chm of Faculty\" is clear.\n\nI've drafted the transcription:\n\nCopy - of Letter to Board June 1890\nCollege Sta June – 90\nTo the Honorable Board of Directors\nA. + m., College of Texas\nGentlemen: I respectfully but earnestly\nrequest that you will give to my vouchers\nand books a searching investigation, in order\nthat you may be able to testify to the correctness\nwith which I have disbursed the funds of the\nA + m College, P.
