There's a left column with \"ALBERT MANTOOTH, President,<br>C. N. SNEED, Secretary.\", a center column with \"J. D. GANN, Cor. Secretary.\", with a little scribble above \"Cor.\" (maybe \"Ex\"?) and \">> OFFICE OF <<\". On the right, it reads \"JOSEPH KERR, Vice-President.<br>C. MANTOOTH, Treasurer.\" The main title, partially obscured by some tape or a censor bar, is \"ANGELI[NA] IMMIGRATION SOCIETY.\" I'm sure it's Angelina. Then the date line reads \"Homer, Texas, Oct 21\" 1881\".\n\nThe letter is addressed to \"Pres. James, A.M. College, Dear Sir\". Then comes the body, which reads: \"We have a small parcel of land in the shape of the diagram below, which we desire to divide in two equal parts by a line running parallel to the base. I have worked the example, and, as I knew to be correct, but other parties are not satisfied with the solution, so, it is agreed to ask you to solve the prob- lem for us. Please let the work remain in full - so that the work will be as plain as possible - I hope to return the favor.\"\n\nThe signature at the bottom looks like \"Yours truly C. N. Sneed,\" which matches the printed name.\n\nThen there is a hand-drawn diagram. It's a trapezoid. The top is labeled \"A 4 chains B\". There's a vertical drop on the right side labeled \"24 chains\". The bottom is labeled \"D 12 chains C\". There's a horizontal line drawn across the middle labeled \"E ... F\". The \"F\" might be a squiggle.\n\n\n",
