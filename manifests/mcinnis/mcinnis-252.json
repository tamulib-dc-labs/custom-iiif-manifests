      "A brief personal letter from attorney A. J. Peeler of the Austin, Texas law firm Peeler & Maxey to Professor Louis L. McInnis at College Station, Texas. Peeler accepts McInnis's invitation to stay with him during an upcoming visit to the College, though he cannot yet confirm his arrival date. The letter demonstrates the professional and social correspondence between legal and academic communities in late nineteenth-century Texas."

My strategy began with a thorough analysis of the image, identifying key elements: the letterhead from Peeler & Maxey, the handwritten date and addressee, the salutation, body of the letter, the closing, and the signature.\n\nMy work follows a line-by-line approach. First, I carefully transcribed each element, noting the decorative fonts, small print, and handwritten portions. I meticulously checked handwriting, paying close attention to words that could be ambiguous, like \"morning\" or \"Resptfly.\" My interpretation is based on context and comparing letters. For instance, the closing \"Rfly &c\" looks like \"Rfly\", and there's no reason to assume otherwise.\n\nI will then apply IIIF-compliant HTML tags (a, b, br, i, img, p, small, span, sub, sup) to structure the output. I'll use `<p>` tags for paragraph blocks, `<b>` for bold headers, `<i>` to distinguish italics. I will also make sure to use `<sup>` for the superscript \"th\" in the date and the abbreviations. Since it's a legal letter, I will also label [Header] and [Signature].\n\nI also checked handwriting interpretation: ensuring proper handling of \"morning\" vs \"Monday\".\n\nAfter drafting the basic transcription, I reviewed my work against the original image to ensure all elements were accounted for.\n\nThe result is a clean, accurate, and structurally correct transcription.\n\n\n",
