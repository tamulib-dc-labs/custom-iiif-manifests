Here's how I'm approaching this:**\n\n1.  **Image Analysis:** Okay, it's a handwritten letter, dating back to 1879, sent from the A&M College Board of Directors to Professor Louis L. McInnis. It seems like it's an official notification about his resignation, plus a tidbit about Adjunct Professors not voting in the faculty. I've got the sender's office room, the date, and the recipient. All the necessary metadata.\n\n2.  **Transcription Strategy:**\n    *   **Headers:** I will start with \"Office Room of the Board of Directors of the A & M College Bryan Texas Novr. 22, 1879.\" – the abbreviation looks like \"Novr.\", and I will be careful on the 22nd.\n    *   **Recipient:** \"Prof. Louis L McInnis, Adjunct Professor of the A & M College. Sir!\" I'm making sure to capture that squiggle at the end.\n    *   **Body:** I'll transcribe this faithfully, capturing the formal language, and the \"22<sup>d</sup>\" date notation.\n    *   **Resolutions:** \"It was resolved\" and \"further resolved\". I will render these as their own lines, to reflect emphasis.\n    *   **Signature:** \"George Pfeuffer, Secretary of the Board\". Need to nail that signature, and I confirmed that George Pfeuffer was associated with the Board around this time.\n\n3.  **Formatting:** I am using HTML tags as instructed. I need to keep line breaks. I have to be careful with \"Nobr.\" versus \"Novr.\" It seems \"Novr.\" is the appropriate abbreviation. Also, the superscript \"d\". \"A & M\" with the stylized ampersand. I'll maintain line breaks. I'll also add a line break before \"It was resolved\", etc.\n\n4.  **Refining Text:** I will copy the text and double check it as I transcribe it into the final output format.\n    *   I'll check the \"Nobr.\" vs. \"Novr.\" one last time. It seems to be \"Novr.\". I'll keep an eye on punctuation. \"Novr. 22, 1879.\"\n    *   I am going to keep the underlining of \"It was resolved\" and \"further resolved\". Since I cannot use `<u>`, I am just going to put each phrase on its own line.\n    *   The middle initial in McInnis, I'm pretty sure that's a cursive 'L'.\n\n5.  **Final Review:** Ok, let's do a final review. Reading the document again, top to bottom. It looks like the layout. It's legible. I am set. I am going to produce the final transcription below.\n\n\n",
