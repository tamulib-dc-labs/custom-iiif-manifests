I'm focusing on providing *only* the transcribed text.\n\nI've analyzed the image to understand its structure. It's a handwritten letter on official letterhead from the Texas Agricultural Experiment Station, complete with lists of staff and board members. I can see the date is July 22nd, 1890, and the handwriting is cursive but generally legible, though there are some crossed-out words. The content revolves around getting signatures related to someone's continued employment. I need to note the layout: center header (TEXAS...), left sidebar (Station Staff), right sidebar (Board).\n\nMy process involves a line-by-line transcription. I'm paying close attention to spelling, punctuation, and handwriting interpretation, keeping the original formatting as closely as possible, and preserving the intended meaning. I'll use the HTML tags as needed for layout (using `<p>`, `<small>`, and `<br>`) and emphasis (e.g., `<sup`> for superscripted letters). I've decided to use `<small>` for the pre-printed header and list elements to distinguish them from the main letter. The sidebars will be transcribed in the order they appear. The 'd' in \"22d\" is definitely superscripted, and I will use `<sup`> for that. I've noted a few instances of handwriting that I'll have to carefully transcribe. I will address any crossed-out sections. I'll stick to transcribing the text without adding comments.\n\nI've carefully examined the handwriting and interpreted it, and I'm ready to produce the final transcription as directed.\n\n\n",
