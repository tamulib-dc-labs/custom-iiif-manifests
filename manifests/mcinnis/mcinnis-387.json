First, I need to make sure I'm following the instructions precisely. This means I'm acting as a professional transcriptionist, focusing on accuracy, interpreting the handwriting as best as possible, and sticking to the given HTML markup (a, b, br, i, img, p, small, span, sub, sup). No strikethrough tags, so I'll need to work around that. I will stick to what the user explicitly said. I'm avoiding any extra conversation; just the transcription.\n\nNow, let's break down the image itself. I see a header \"State Agricultural and Mechanical College OF TEXAS,\" with a sub-header, and a small printed list of names to the left. The date is right-aligned and handwritten, which will need careful attention. The salutation, address, and body text are all in cursive. I can see a few words or lines crossed out, and those will require careful handling given the HTML constraints.\n\nI'll start by making a mental draft, getting all the text down. I'll include all the characters. I'll put it in plain text first, then I'll start adding the formatting. Then, I'll pay close attention to the details: the \"th\" in the dates needs superscript. I'm checking the strikethrough, spelling, and punctuation. The handwriting can be tricky. Words like \"whatever\" are a little ambiguous, but I'll make sure to get it as close as possible to what's written. I need to be precise, especially with names like \"Louis L McInnis\". I see a closed 'o' that looks a bit like an 'i' in \"wring/wrong\", but the context makes \"wrong\" the right choice.\n\nThe instructions say to transcribe everything, so if a word looks like \"Txas\" rather than \"Texas,\" I will write \"Txas\". But then again the prompt says to interpret the handwritten text accurately, so I will write \"Txas\" and/or \"Texas\" as appropriate.\n\nRegarding the layout, I will use `<p>` tags for paragraph breaks. I will use `<small>` for the small print in the header. The struck-through text is a challenge. Since I can't use an actual strikethrough, I'll put the text in with the `<small>` tags.\n\nI'm double-checking the markup and spelling. I'm focusing on those superscripts, any potential abbreviations, and those tricky handwriting interpretations. The closing is straightforward, but I have to be careful with \"Truly\". I will confirm the date is 1890, the name is \"Louis\", etc.\n\nOne final check on the structure before I generate the final text, and I'm ready.\n\n\n",
