                                "value": "**Transcription Analysis & Refinement**\n\nOkay, here's the deal. I'm looking at this handwritten letter, trying to figure out what it says. It's addressed to \"Prof L. L. McInnis\" and dated \"June 1st 84\" - that's June 1st, 1884, in Caledonia, Texas, I think. The handwriting is cursive, and some of it is a bit messy. I need to make a solid transcription, so here's my thought process.\n\nFirst, I'm trying to break down each part. \"Dear Sir\" is the greeting. Then the body: The writer, \"Henry D Garrison\" or something like that, wants to know if he can re-enter the \"A & M C\" (that's Agricultural and Mechanical College) in the same class he was in when he left. I think he is asking this. The \"A & M C\" is heavily emphasized in the text. I am certain.\n\nThen, he's considering returning this fall with two of his friends. He attended school for five months after leaving A&M, and finished \"the seventh book in Robinson Geom\" - geometry. It sounds like he did geometry. I know Robinson's Geometry was common. I am also sure it says \"Geom\" at the end, not \"Gram\" - even though I thought of it. Also, he \"reviewed Arthmetic Algebra\". That's a misspelling of \"Arithmetic\", which is common. I am also sure I see \"Arithmetic\".\n\nI am making sure that the text is \"Texs\", not \"Tex\". The s at the end is a squiggle, but it looks like an s. The 1st is in superscript: \"1<sup>st</sup>\".\n\nThe layout is important. I am trying to keep the paragraphs as I see them. The line \"If I\" appears above the words \"should again enter\". I'm making sure to capture that nuance. The \"If I\" is a bit indented. I am sure. The word \"enter\" in one of the lines is messy.\n\nA difficult word is in the line \"A & M C could I enter\". The word \"enter\" is scribbled and looks like \"rule g\" or \"take\" or something else. I will stick with \"enter\", though I am considering \"reenter\". The intent is clearer, given it parallels the previous line.\n\nThe closing is \"Yours Truly\", but the \"Yours\" is really faint. You can barely see it. I have the name as \"Henry D Garrison\".\n\nLet's summarize it.\nHere is the text.\n\n<p>Caledonia Texs<br>June 1<sup>st</sup> 84</p>\n<p>Prof L. L.
