I've got a handwritten letter from an image here, dated June 27th, 1890, from Melissa, Texas, addressed to Professor S. S. McInnis in College Station. The writer is T. M. Scott, and I'm going to carefully transcribe this thing, line by line.\n\nFirst, I see the date and location – always important context. Then, I'm reading Scott's actual words. He's heard about the \"Board's\" actions (whatever that entails), and it seems he's responding to a note from the Professor. He's rather direct, really. He questions the Professor's state of mind, especially considering the Professor's \"business qualifications\". Scott advises him to \"spurt up\" – I'm thinking he means \"make an effort\" – and suggests talking to Capt. Fowlkes about banking. Clearly, Scott believes teaching isn't the best path.\n\nHe's got this optimistic tone, thinking this will be a good financial year. He's downplaying the Professor's concerns and encouraging him to take action. He mentions that he's back home \"gitting clear of dirt\". Seems like they're working hard. Then he references Micawber – always a good touch. He's sending love to Mrs. McInnis, her mother, and the \"little One,\" which is very thoughtful of him.\n\nAfter reading the letter thoroughly, I'm formatting it according to the requested guidelines, aligning the header and signature where they need to be, and making sure the lines are broken appropriately. Now, this should be ready to go!\n\n\n",
